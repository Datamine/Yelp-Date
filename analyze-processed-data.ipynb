    "Now we need to classify reviews: using the text, we want to identify the ones in which the reviewer was on a date. \n",
    "This is actually a very difficult classification problem, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All the data is unlabelled. We have no training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If someone is on a date, it's not clear how apparent that will be in a review. Some reviewers may not allude to that at all. Though including words like \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" would make it clear, we have to assume that a nontrivial portion of the yelp reviews were written by people on dates who did not mention that fact. Conversely, if someone is *not* on a date, it seems quite unlikely for the reviewer to mention that in any explicit way that we can encode in a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are other difficulties in binary topic-classification of textual data (e.g. setting thresholds), the two points above confound any sweeping analysis. Though it's possible to use unsupervised/semi-supervised methods to construct some set of words associated with an abstract date-topic, the fundamental issue is that some very significant portion of the reviews may not carry a feature that lets us classify them correctly. In other words, the approach given by \"if we detect date-words, classify it as a date, otherwise, classify it as a non-date\" may lead to a high number of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we go for a more explicit approach: rather than trying to use the entire dataset, on which any attempt at accurate binary classification will almost certainly fail, we will isolate the reviews that are *certainly* dates and *certainly* non-dates. This will let us make a more explicit comparison, though we may also then use these statistics as reference points when comparing with the corpus of all reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we identify certain dates as reviews that include the phrase \"on a date\", which is generally not used in any other context (i.e. the probability of this particular phrase referring to a datetime seems exceedingly low), and the phrase \"by myself\" to indicate when the reviewer is not on a date. We'll be careful to look out for negation of either of those two phrases."

       " 'a gentleman caller asked how i felt about comedy clubs i answered his question skeptically because i was just sure that i didnt understand what he meant i like comedy clubsi guessi dont have a lot of experience with them i suppose why i felt like maybe there was this dark underbelly to comedy clubs that i just didnt understand he explained that he didnt get to go to comedy clubs very often because some of his friends refused to go as we made plans to visit the improv in the flats we pondered the reasons why someone would not like a comedy club we couldnt come up with a definitive reason but we figured there are two big reasons1 you dont want to be the target of jokes 2 you dont want to feel awkward when the comedian just isnt funny we encountered this first big fear as soon as we were shown to our seats we decided to do dinner before hand so we arrived around an hour before show time as their website demands of those who plan on eating dinner we looked at one another as he picked up his tickets and he said oh boy i hope they didnt put us up front upon seeing our table we both knew we had two huge targets on us we were clearly on a date and sitting not only next to the stage but so close that the comedians were going to have to step over us to get on the stage we are the perfect people to heckle nonthreatening and good sports when i had to get up during the main act to use the restroom i emotionally prepared myself for whatever he could through at me but surprisingly he was pleasant and funny with his rendition of the bladder control drug commercials theme song gotta go gotta go gotta go right now the other big fear people have over comedy clubs is awkwardness what do you do when the comedian is just not funny we certainly experienced that with all three comedians we saw at the improv it is inevitable a comedian will bomb with at least one joke i think what makes him a professional is how he handles it all three of these comedians all acknowledged the fact that some of their jokes just werent as funny as they thought all three got laughs in their response to bad jokes they found a way to smooth it over so we never had to feel that awkwardness i would like to suggest there is a third fear associated with comedy clubs felt only by people in their twenties 3 do people our age go to comedy clubs they just arent hipthere is certainly a sense among twenty somethings that only old people go to places like the improv i am not going to dive into the sociology of that thinking or what the demographics actually are at comedy clubs i am just going to say that is the perception i will admit that i was on the younger end of those there but certainly not the youngest there was a nice mix of ages in the crowd and i had a great time i took advantage of the fact that it wasnt the it place in town and ordered a strawberry daiquiri i feel that there are very few times that i can have self respect and order a strawberry daiquiri don pablos comes to mind a great aunts birthday party maybe a graduation party as a somewhat fashionable 26yearold woman with quisihipster friends a strawberry daiquiri is not acceptable while out on the town but at the improv i figured that my indiscretion could slip by the daiquiri was great i recommend everyone order daiquiris i was also pleased with my burger and fries both were tasty i have a new rule whenever i am presented with a menu which includes both entrees which seem slightly pretentious and pub grub with the pub grub listed at around 10 less than the entrees i must order something from the pub grub category or else i will feel totally scammed trust me on this if the entrees were that great the pub grub would be great tooand there wouldnt be a price discrepancy and the pub grub wouldnt seem so grubby i dont think a little fear of heckling and awkwardness should stop anyone from stopping by the improv i hear people complain all the time that they are tired of the old dinner and a movie routine so mix it up and try the improv on your next date we had plenty of time to talk before the show over dinner and then got to laugh together and at our selves at points during the show we left knowing one another a little better and having more to talk about if it makes you nervous to be picked out of the audience ask for a table in the back if it makes you nervous when the comedian isnt funnywell then order some daiquiris everything will be a little funnier',\n",

       " 'yes ive been to a vegas strip club  but i promise im not the dbag you may take me for  read on and ill try and make my case if my gf reads this im a dead manyou see its not my fault  i was actually dragged here by a friend a while back  she and her fiancee were engaged that night and wanted to hit a strip club to celebrate yeah makes absolutely no sense to me either but hey thats how she rolls  so we left the safety and comfort of the bellagio and asked a cabby to take us to the hottest strip club in vegas based on the look on his face i dont think we were the first to make that requestfull disclosure i was a strip club virgin having made it to my 40s without so much as a lap dance  i had never paid for female attention nor the simulation of it but as i was recently single i was open minded  and here i was in vegas with some friends who wanted to take a walk on the wild side  to steal a quote from risky business what the fkas we walked into cheetahs i realized immediately we werent in kansas anymore  the place was dark and smoky what a surprise and there were two gigantic black bouncers at the door and they werent smiling those guys had to be over 65 and were built like two industrial refrigerators  as we quietly tiptoed past them my friend recounted a story of another club where the bouncers grabbed a dude slammed his head through the rear exit door and tossed him into a dumpster  apparently he had the bad taste to actually touch one of the girls  needless to say this made more than a minor impression on methe girls strutting around were all surprisingly modelesque i had expected tattooed meth addicts and quite friendly too  not more than a millisecond after my ass hit the faux leather chair this gorgeous russian blonde walks up and offers me a lap dance in a sultry accent vould jou like a dahnce  i swallowed hard but couldnt manage a reply so i just nodded quickly like a jack rabbit on a date  while the bond girl did her bumps and grinds i tried to keep an image in my head of how the inside of a dumpster might actually smell  this kept my hands from wandering and after a few minutes the trial by fire was over  i handed her some money i wasnt in any shape to count it and she smiled kissed me on the cheek and slowly sauntered off  the room seemed to have gotten a lot warmer i grabbed my watered down martini but couldnt decide whether to sip it or just dump it over my headmy plan was to just have one dance so i could check it off my bucket list and bolt for the exit but just when i thought i was out of the woods my friend asks me so which of the girls do you think is the hottest  i scanned the room and there was this smokin brunette in her early 20s dancing on one of the poles  i had noticed her when we first arrived  im more of a penelope cruz than a sharon stone guy so this girl was definitely my type and berhot think jane margolis on breaking bad  i nodded at her shes hot  before i finished my sentence my friend calls her over do you mind giving this guy a dance  i shot my friend a thanks for that glance and then immediately started to turn to jelly as jane walked over to me her gaze locked on mine the entire journey the rest is pretty much a blur  jane did her thing while i meditated on the dumpster again  i noticed that her dance seemed to be taking longer than the russians but hey maybe she was just into me sarcasm  when she finally finished she informed me that i owed her three bills as she nonchalantly pulled out an overflowing bank bag in case i needed change i guess  i was fine with the price but asked her how she came by it  apparently she had given me not one but six dances  hmm i was going to ask her how one could tell when a dance started or ended but i noticed mr t and his boyfriend looking over at us and decided id just settle up  she took my money and walked off with a strut that had a distinct suckerrrr vibe to it  gosh and i thought she really liked me rolls eyes   right after jane strolled off back to mordor no doubt pussy galore reacquired her target  michael vould jou like another dahnce  i smiled but waived her off  i was ready to leave  you see the whole stripper thing has never made much sense to me  its like sliding a decadent chocolate cake in front of a diabetic and youre the diabetic  i dont know about you but i want to taste the cake not just stare at the damn thing  in short i found the whole scene pretty surreal and not quite as stimulating as i had expected  sure if i were a college bro and still had that 200lb testosterone gorilla on my back it probably would have been more titillating  but my general takeaway was meh  the costbenefit ratio just wasnt there  seriously who the hell wants to be teased for 600hour  ymmv of course',\n",

       " 'im back logged on my reviews but this one got put to the front of the line because i have to say it was a major disappointment experiencing this place i usually wait till i try a place a few times before going star crazy but as stated i have things i need to say the reason they get two stars instead of zero and a escalation  is  when i called to ask wait times and when we were seated both the female who answered and the gentleman who seated us both who sadly i didnt get their names were friendly and informedfood  quality and booze was good even if my experience was not  so lets get on with this yelp rage review from another one of those hangry yelpers shall we so driving down sahara on our way to indian friday night we drove past nacho daddy and i recalled i tried them out originally at a yelp event and fell hard for their mexican corn offthe cob so of course i decided before my movie date saturday it was time for margaritas and some mexican nachos  fast fwd to my evening nacho daddy experience shawn our waiter set the tone for my saturday night meal to where this place is going to be tabled for quite sometime before i try them again which is lame cause i totally planned to bring someone who isnt a square bear my bf doesnt drink much that will drink and  shoot scorpion shots when i was photo ready cause admittedly i was in cozy clothes to prep for three hours at the movies after so i was not fancy  to do cute tourist like selfie scorpion shots my biggest pet peeve when dining is being left thirsty  i need soda usually diet or water and refills often lol my server failed from the jump with that i had asked some questions about the premium margaritas  he didnt really say much but the jalapeo is too spicy for him so  i got this cucumber chili one he recommended which wasnt on the menu but he told me about and my guy got a raspberry one both of which were tasty imo for the 1112 price tag but the service went all bad when shawn left to get those without asking if i need water but also having to be prompted to get some  worst thing is he not only brought our margaritas before the water that was requested but we had to ask for the water again and i continually saw him walking around talking to other co workers  being friendly im sorry he can love his co workers but service should prevail especially when i need water he didnt recommend stuff and i had to do the digging and just responded we dont have it anymore so it got old for me really fast now when date night occurs i typically go for app two entrees and dessert plus booze   this situation already had  gone downhill fast  it gous to one entree maybe shawn thought due to my attire i wasnt interested in spending money  here is the thing usually i still eat my food and spend my money but i escalate the issue  however being on a date and having my guy prefer to not make a scene i went another route which is not order stuff to lower my tab which helps make me feel less horrible for not tipping well but it leaves me to where im hangry and upset if you do go here check in  on yelp and youll get a free house margarita it was delicious  so i may go back to the bar sometime but  be advised i only got that free margarita to make sure he knew i was checked in but also cause i thought maybe the manager or supervisor would have to authorize it and come by cause i dont usually do top shelf so if i give it a thumbs upso its  fair to say they have a good bartender filet nachos won the entree choice due to recommendation of the dude who seated us that was nice they are 18 something and huge so we shared those fine but it was lack meat and had way too many beans but the taste was good  those beans are where shawn and i went to the point of no return cause i was going to try another premium margarita and let my guy get his dessert but my meal ended with my boyfriend and i waiting so long for shawn to check back that the excessive beans on our nachos that had no meat were spread out on the dish and shawn comes up and says are you done playing with your beans which a i guess if we had aligned and related that would of been cute but we didnt b you see it not eaten and dont ask what happened or how everything wasc you had enough time to watch  lurk but not check inmy boyfriend really wanted to try the churro banana split  but he had to make due with ben and jerrys at redrock why cause i couldnt handle shawn or the sight of beans any longerit also delayed my finding good movie seats so thanks shawn you win but seriously overall this was just not a good experience but the quality of food was not bad it was meh ',\n",

       " 'i went here during a sort of prescreening of the place last week and was overall impressed the small amount of food offerings are pretty tasty and unique but i feel like they sort of fell flat on the presentation i wouldnt mind seeing them tweak a few of the dishes so it seems like you are getting your moneys worth however for german street food it was all pretty greatthe beer selection is what i was most interested in and it did not fail me the menu had a large selection of cans bottles and drafts all reasonably priced for a 9th floor rooftop beer garden in downtown most bottled beers were priced 812 with a few hitting 18 draft beer was also in the same 812 ballpark the menu also had a few cocktail offerings but they were mostly based on beer and did not appeal to methe atmosphere was pretty great having been in the building during the previous tenancy it was nice to see how they changed and decorated it to accommodate the beer garden on the 9th floor youre well above all the traffic and commotion coming from william penn place below and also get some great views around the city skylinethe majority of the tables seemed to be made for 6 people so if youre there on a date and the place is packed you might not get the intimate setting youre hoping for it seems like they are going for a more communal style seating but i do believe there were a few smaller tables set up as wellthey did have some games set up which was a nice touch giant jenga a large connect four type game and some sort of two player puzzlestyle game where it seemed like the object was for you and a teammate to use two strings and a plastic holder to get a ball to the top of a wall full of holes without losing it there were two of those games side by side so it seems like it could have been a nice competitive coop game against another teamas for the staff most of the serverswaiters seemed new but they definitely did their research on the menu before starting our waiter although a bit shy or awkward at first was able to make great beer suggestions for us as we stared at the seemingly neverending list in front of us he also allowed us to taste test some of the beers before we made our final decisions most of the beer we had paired very well with the food we had orderedso overall i rate this place 5 stars as i feel it is a wonderful addition to the downtown beer scene while offering its own unique style being outdoors and on the 9th floor really sets it apart from the other places around downtown i will definitely be going back in the future and look forward to it doing well',\n",

       " 'if you look at my two other yelp reviews you will see positive reviews of a couple of restaurants ive been to normally if a restaurant is lame which is rare i wont even review it but i am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant not for the food which was somewhat edible but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the placemy girlfriend carol and i were walking through scottsdale it was just past noon on a recent sunday so we were thinking about lunch we passed italian grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall the lunch part of the menu had most entrees at 8 ill treat you to lunch she said sounds good said iwe went in and there were very few customers three or four people were sitting at the bar we were seated quickly the server who was polite brought us menus the first thing we noticed was that there were no 8 items on it all of the lunch items were priced at 13 or more so we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building heres what he said yes those are 8 items if you get them al la carte of course al la carte suggests that you can get say the baked ravioli for 8 if you get nothing else on the side but then the server added but these items do come with either soup or salad hmmm it clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was 8 and you still got a soup or salad carol and i looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders i ordered the baked ravioli she ordered a vegetable pasta disheach of these were 8 on the outside menu but 13 on the menu he handed us he clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a lunch special we also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea thats all we orderedas we awaited our meals there was some person standing around the lobby and i heard him say something loudly about jews which got my attention he seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so i thought some idiotand tuned him out and remember this was just after noonthe food arrived and was fine i got exactly four mediumsized ravioli on my plate along with a salad the drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place he looked a bit like donald trump same age and attitude and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left earafter we ate we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled 40 not only that but the entrees were written down as 14 each what kind of weird mistake was this carol who doesnt mind confronting issues like this had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiterthen i heard the loud guy yapping at her i did not hear what he was saying but it sounded at a distance like he was arguing with her as my attention turned to him my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and i thought that this guy must be the manager or owner carol is from long island and is used to new york attitudes so i figured all was good this onesided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying lets get outta hereas it turned out the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill from 14 to 13 per entree and according to carol he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk and obnoxious he asked her to get a load of the queers at the bar and that was just the beginning of his tiradeshe said that the owner wondered why i the boyfriend wasnt paying the bill and that no woman should pay when a man can pay i have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house carol thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho new yorker told him that she was from long island in response he said long island isnt new york only spoiled brats live on long island i grew up in manhattan in chelsea on 29th and 9th he asked carol why we were in scottsdale she said we live in tucson and have been visiting arcosanti he said why would you live in tucson its a dump i had a bagel business on 1st ave in tucson and it was a terrible place he also added i was at arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there i suppose this was the point in the conversation when carol laughed and walked awayas we were walking back to our car and carol was relating this story we knew that this information needs to get out and seeing what many others have written about this restaurant i think you can see we arent exaggerating the owner of italian grotto is some drunken misanthrope named gary horowitz so why his comment about jews and no one should be supporting his businessalso see httpwwwphoenixnewtimescom20010503restaurantsvenivicivendettafull',\n",
       " 'ooooooo i love this place ive come here several times and had a good experience every time the food is great if youre looking for authentic italian food this is your place the atmosphere is perfect for an italian restaurant from the tablecloths to the music to the staff i tried one of their seafood pastas once that was really good and the last time i got a chicken dish with pasta that was great as well i like how they have the open windowdoor things too so it feels kind of like youre outside but youre actually inside it isnt all that cheap so definitely be aware of that you also get bread and a salad or soup before your dish so come hungry i always leave with leftovers which makes me happy great spot to come with family or on a date stiff drinks too ',\n",
       " 'my husband and i discovered the phipps shortly after moving to pittsburgh in early 2014  we loved it enough to book the broderie room for our wedding ceremony the following year  after settling on a date constance took great care of us answering any questions with grace and handling the stressful moments easily  our rehearsal and ceremony were both flawless with the help of constance and ashley  a big thank you to the phipps for a beautiful wedding day',\n",
